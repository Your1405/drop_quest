# Drop Quest

Drop Quest is a STEM education application created by Team Suriname and Team Cambodia during the 2021 FIRST Global Challenge. One branch of the FGC this year, was a solutions challenge where we had to identify a problem in a certain topic. We both chose education in the first phase. In our second and third phase, we had to form an alliance with someone in our same topic group. We chose team Cambodia, because of our similar ideas and also our similar passion for STEM.
